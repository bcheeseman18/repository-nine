<!-- Getting started modifying the DOM.

Create an application that displays random user profiles that 
include a photo and name along with a 'like' and 'nope' button. 
If the user clicks 'like', you should print out "Likes [user name]" in the console. 
If the user clicks 'nope', you should print out "[user name] has been noped" in the console. 
Once the user has been liked or noped their profile should become faded (have its opacity reduced in CSS).
Add a clickable button that adds a new random profile to the list. -->
